#### Mission selection strategy:

When there is an event: Choose the mission with the highest number of event item rewards (first-time reward + fixed reward).

### Reward Weight

By going to Options - Phantom Temple, you can set the reward weight. The calculation method is as follows:

$$Sort = weight \times \frac{N^{lv\_current}_{star\_current}}{N^{lv\_max}_{star\_max}}$$

Suppose the settings are as follows:

- Rune Exchange Coupon: 5
- Potential Orb: 3

There are two tasks:

- Task A rewards with Rune Exchange Coupon x10. The reward for a 127-level 10-star task is Rune Exchange Coupon x100, calculated as $0.5 = 5 \times \frac{10}{100}$.
- Task B rewards with Potential Orb x30. The reward for a 127-level 10-star task is Potential Orb x2000, calculated as $0.045 = 3 \times \frac{30}{2000}$.

Ultimately, Task A will be chosen for the battle.

## FAQs

### How do I run multiple instances?

To run multiple instances, modify the port number in `appsettings.user.json`. For example, change the port to 5700:

```json5
{
  {
    // original contents
  },
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://localhost:5700"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
